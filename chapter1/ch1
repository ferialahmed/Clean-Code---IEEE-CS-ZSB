Clean code ch1:
•	Messy code is a significant impediment.
•	Writing code with a mess and deciding to clean it later after finishing the program will take extra time than fixing this mess at once.
•	The only way to go fast is to keep the code clean.
•	Making any change in a code with a mess will increase this mess and will be difficult or almost impossible to clear it.
•	Bad code tempts the mess to grow.
•	Bad code makes the concept of the program unclear. However ,clean code is focused and never obscures the programmer’s intent.
•	In clean code, each function and class exposes a single minded attitude that remains undistracted by the surrounding details.
•	Clean code should contain only what’s necessary so it’s readable and easy to be perceived.
•	Clean code Is easy for other programmer to change and features to it.
•	Clean code must run all the tests.
•	Clean code must contain no duplication.
•	Any code even if it’s a clear code rots over time, so it should be maintained over time.
