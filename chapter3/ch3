Chapter 3:
•	Functions should be small.
•	Function should do one thing.
•	Avoid using switch statement as much as possible.
•	Use descriptive names describe what the function does.
•	Ideal number of arguments for a function is zero then one then two.
•	Avoid using more than two arguments.
•	There are two reasons to pass a single argument into a function which are asking a question about the argument or operating on that argument, transforming it into something else and return it. 
•	Avoid using any monadic functions that don’t follow the previous reasons.
•	Avoid passing flag arguments.
•	It’s preferable using Exceptions instead of Returning error codes from command function.
•	There should be one return statement, no break or continue and never ever goto statements.
