Chapter 5:
•	The source file should be like a newspaper, where the name should be simple but explanatory.
•	The topmost parts of the source file should provide the high-level concepts and algorithms.
•	Each group of lines that represent a complete thought should be separated from each other with blank lines.
•	Lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically dense.
•	Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible.
•	Local variable should appear at the top of each function.
•	Control variables for loops should usually be declared within the loop statement.
•	Instance variable should be declared at the top of the class.
•	If one function calls another, they should be vertically close and the caller should be above the callee.
•	Each line of code should be short, following the rule of never scrolling to the right.
•	The assignment operators should be surrounded with white space to accentuate them. 
•	The function name and the opening parenthesis shouldn’t be separated by white spaces, as the function name and its arguments are closely related.
